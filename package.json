  "description": "Exercise is an essential component for a healthy mind and body. However, working out today, given the current pandemic, has become hard and lackluster. People seeking to improve their physical fitness have varying ranges of experience when it comes to exercise, and tracking one’s exercise goals has become tedious and cumbersome. The main purpose of this project is to design and develop a cross-platform application that makes working out from anywhere easy. Werk It provides an easy way to customize workout plans and communicate one’s progress with friends. Werk It is unique from its competing products such as Apple HealthKit and Fitbit in its adaptability and ability to personalize workouts and statistical graphs.",
